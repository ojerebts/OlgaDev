# iOS Portfolio
Hi, I am Olga! I have over 10+ years of professional experience writing beautiful, native iOS Apps for iPhone and iPad, using Swift and Objective-C. I have been writing iPhone apps since before ARC(automatic reference counting) was introduced in Xcode. Take a look at my projects.

## Globant
<img src="https://github.com/ojerebts/ojerebts/blob/main/img/gap%20icons.png" width="260"> <br/>
At Globant, I began as a Senior iOS Engineer and swiftly advanced to the position of iOS Tech Lead, overseeing a team of six engineers for our client Gap. In this role, I collaborated closely with business, QA, and backend teams to ensure the timely delivery of features within an aggressive release cycle. I actively contributed to major architecture decisions alongside other leads, onboarded and trained new members of the team, and made sure we follow architecture guidelines through daily code reviews. The app itself has a number of architectural complexities such as **supporting 4 different brands within one app**, consuming dynamic information from a variety of backend systems, payment processing, shopping cart, membership benefits, advanced filtering and search capabilities, and many others. <br/>

## Health App Prototype
For this freelancing project, I developed a quick prototype that was fetching data from a variety of databases, files, and online sources with medical information. The medications information was then displayed in Apple's Health app. The app was designed to enhance user experience in Health app, providing vital information on possible medical contraindication, interactions, and adverse reactions for the user.

## Roka Security Messaging App

Roka Security is a computer service firm specializing in cyber security. RokaCom Messaging App was a secure messaging application that allowed encrypted messaging and voice calling over wifi. For this project, I implemented two main functions: end-to-end encryption via SHA-256 encryption and voice calling using open source project [Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/). 

## goPanache

goPanache was a 'one stop shop' for barbers and beauty professionals that allowed them to showcase products, services, book appointments, and sell products. As one of the earliest lead engineers on the project, I worked on developing the entire application from mockups to shipping it to the App Store. The app had a variety of complex features such as supporting multiple service locations for barbers, accepting credit card payments, displaying online shop with products to upsell, book appointments and pay before or after the service, search available barbers in the area, cancel appointments and many others.

## Wildfyre 
Wildfyre was an app prototype similar to Periscope, enabling creators to stream live while allowing the audience to participate by liking, commenting, and watching the stream afterward.  

## Millennial Media
Millennial Media was a mobile advertising platform providing ability for developers to include their SDK in the apps and receiving a portion of ad revenue. SDK supported various formats of ads: banners, full screen video, and inline ads. While working on SDK team at the company, I implemented internal app for our QA team to test variety of ad formats quickly and efficiently. 

## [Sadhana Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sadhana-tracker/id898291229) - #89 in Health & Fitness section on App Store!

Personal app I wrote to assist spiritual practitioners to track their meditation practice. As of June 2024 **it occupies #89 place in Health & Fitness section!** Main features include ability to add meditation practice for a pre-determined number of days (40, 90, 120, and 1000 days), checkin on a daily basis, share the progress, receive push notifications as reminders, and add notes to reflect on the practice itself.

Personal timer app that is no longer supported by me. Kirtan Kriya is one of the fundamental practices in Kundalini Yoga. This timer app is a great assistant the practice of Kirtan Kriya that allows to adjust the time from 11 min to 2,5 hours if desired. App allows to choose a music to practice along and alerts the practitioner when the intervals of the practice are finished. Other app features include: screen autolock to prevent the screen from dimming during your practice, choice of vibration vs chimes in settings, and background information on the practice itself.

This is my first personal app that I wrote with inspirational quotes from a master of Kundalini Yoga. Since it was launched in 2012, it still gets daily downloads and excellent reviews. To this day, I see people using the app on Instagram and posting screenshots from it. Features include ability to swipe through quotes, bookmark favorite quotes, and receive a random quote via Today Widget on iPhone screen.
